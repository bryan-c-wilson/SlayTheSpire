# SlayTheSpire
Goal is to create and publish Slay The Spire predictive model and Slay The Spire R Shiny App

## Slay the Spire Run Data

This repository contains scripts and analysis for Slay the Spire runs. 

### Download the Full Run Data

The full dataset for the Slay the Spire runs is available for download from the following link:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/k9zjn8pgyq24llu/november.7z?dl=0

After downloading, please place the files in the `data/` directory of this repository to run the scripts.
JSON files were slow to upload so I converted to RDS to run faster. This is documented in the R initialization script.

### Sample Data

A small sample dataset is included in the `data/` directory for testing purposes.


You can interact with the live version of this R Shiny app exploring deaths in Slay the Spire data here: https://bryan-c-wilson.shinyapps.io/Slay_The_Spire_Exploration/
